                    using three.js together while acting as a front end and developing it from a user perspective. And
                    we are learning JavaScript and react together, and we are learning other publishers and new

                <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Technology in possession</h2>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    I learn the basics and intermediate courses of JavaScript every day.
                    It's basic, and if necessary, it's clear why you learn and use it by learning.
                </p>
                <h3>TypeScript</h3>
                <p>
                    TypeScript eliminates bugs in advance by specifying the purpose in the code and generating errors in variables or functions that are not appropriate for the purpose. It also provides feedback before auto-completion or execution of the code, which can be debugged simultaneously with work, thereby increasing productivity. In fact, according to a study, 15% of all JavaScript bugs can be detected in TypeScript beforehand.
                </p>
                <h3>NextJS</h3>
                <p>
                    An open-source JavaScript web framework created for the React, it provides a variety of features, such as **server side rendering server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), incremental static regeneration (ISR)** that the React does not have.
                </p>       
                <h3>React</h3>
                <p>
                    A web browser reads the text document on the website, turns it into a tree structure called the Document Object Model (DOM), and shows it to the user, and web developers update the contents of the website by changing this DOM tree in response to the user's response. However, it is not good for performance to refresh the entire screen with each small change. React introduced Virtual DOM to address this issue.

                    Virtual DOM is a copy of the real DOM, and only the parts that web developers want to make changes in Virtual DOM are modified. After that, React finds the difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM, and only reflects the difference in the real DOM. I think this method of improving performance by minimizing unnecessary screen updates is the reason for the library's selection called React.
                </p>
                <h3>Recoil</h3>
                <p>
                    The unidirectional flow of readers makes it easy to debug the state, but setting up action, decoder, selector, and store at the beginning is extremely cumbersome and forces you to add a lot of code. After Redux Saga, a library called redux-toolkit came out to reduce the code and make it simple, but the initial setting is still cumbersome.
                    Recoil reduces this hassle and has the following advantages.
                    Address global health management issues.
                    The running curve is low; there are no new principles and logic to learn.
                    Pretty simple to use. Most like React.
                </p>
                <h3>React-router-dom</h3>
                <p>
                    React Router is responsible for deciding which page to link the URL to.
                    Then you can simply use the link tag, but why use React Router?
                    ¬†
                    By default, the react is a single page application (SPA).
                    Changes in all components occur within a single page.
                    Moving to another URL does not replace the entire page, but only changes in components within one page.
                    In this environment, the user cannot bookmark the desired page or perform the back function because there is no history.
                    These shortcomings of the react can be supplemented with React Router.

                <h3>React-hook-form</h3>
                <p>
                    The non-control component refers to a component whose value is not controlled by React as opposed to the control component.

                    When the non-control component method is used, it has the same memory address, so it does not synchronize values in real time like control components, and if you press the submit button without having to manage the value by state, you will receive the value.
                    
                    It is not necessary to increase the state even if the input form increases, and even if the value changes, it is not re-rendered. Preventing unnecessary re-rendering in the react helps to improve performance.
